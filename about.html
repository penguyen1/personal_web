        <div id="bio">
            <p>I am a first generation Vietnamese-American, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. My role models are my parents
               because they are the prime examples of achieving anything through hardwork, perserverance and a smile. Growing up, 
               I had a remarkable aptitude in math, athletics, problem-solving and interpersonal skills, which led me to take an
               introductory course to computer programming in college. Ever since that semester, I instantly fell in love with programming 
               and knew that I wanted to pursue a degree and career in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I am an ambitious, creative, collaborative and versatile individual determined to create valuable web and 
               end-user experiences within an organization that will lead to a lasting relationship and career 
               in the field of Web Development. I thrive in fast-paced environments, striving to produce high 
               quality results and continuously focus on finding the best methods to build exceptional products.</p>
