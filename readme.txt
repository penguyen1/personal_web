                     Hello and Welcome! 


This repository contains my personal biography webpage files created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. Will add more to webpage over time.

Below is a brief description of each file:

1. home.html - first webpage visitor sees - greets visitor 

2. about.html - displays pictures of me and a brief blurb about myself

3. contact.html - allows visitor to leave their email and send me a message (submissions do not work yet) (no back-end server created yet)
